# Variational Cluster Approximation

An equilibrium Variational Cluster Approximation code.

The code is based on:  
* SciFortran [https://github.com/aamaricci/SciFortran]  
* DMFT_Tools [https://github.com/aamaricci/DMFTtools]

### REQUIRES

SciFortran
DMFTtools

### INSTALLATION
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_TYPE=(TESTING/DEBUG) -DEXE=(FILE IN ../drivers) 
make
```
### HOW IT WORKS

The user has to provide the hopping matrices for the cluster and the lattice (in the cluster basis). Optionally, a bath can be fed to the program (type "normal" of DMFT-ED). VCA_SOLVE returns the value of the Potthoff potential for the input the user provides. Minimization procedure or plots of Î© must be implemented by the user. Periodization must be implemented by the user (examples are provided in drivers).

### TODOs

- [x] save weights&poles in file as gf_cluster_restart.vca
- [ ] make it possible to pass t as a (Nlso,Nlso,Nk) object (useful for
superconducting case, that is not realizable in this branch)
- [x] calculate the Self-Energy
- [x] implement G-scheme periodization
- [x] fix flags for the integration routines (actually in Scifor)
- [ ] extend to orbital-resolved case
- [x] add bath
- [x] add sample periodization routines in drivers
- [x] add finite T case
